# UcBerkeley-Scheme Interpreter
In this project, you will develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. As you proceed, think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. The subset of the language used in this project is described in the functional programming section of Composing Programs. Since we only include a subset of the language, your interpreter will not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters.

You will also implement some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. You should find that much of what you have learned about Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.

For this project, we have released an alternate version of the project which provides much less guidance in the project specification as well as a minimal amount of starter code. It is appropriate for students with a substantial amount of prior coding experience who want a rather challenging project. It will be worth no more points than the standard version, but can be completed instead of the standard version for full credit.

Later, there will also be an open-ended graphics contest (released separately) that challenges you to produce recursive images in only a few lines of Scheme. As an example, the picture above abstractly depicts all the ways of making change for $0.50 using U.S. currency. All flowers appear at the end of a branch with length 50. Small angles in a branch indicate an additional coin, while large angles indicate a new currency denomination. In the contest, you too will have the chance to unleash your inner recursive artist.
